# Instagram media grabber

## Getting started
- npm i
- npm run webpack
- node src/bundle.js <instagram_username> OR npm run start (for "dopesnow")
- dist/media.csv

## Description
My task was to get the list of Dopesnow's followers, but there were some problems with
permissions (with scope=follower_list)

I got the token for scope=public_content, so, I decided to change the task
and take recent user's media instead of followers

I think it did not change the essence of the assignment
